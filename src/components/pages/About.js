                I am a truck driver who loves to drive. I've driven to all 48 lower states
                picking up and delivering loads for all sorts of businesses. I am also a father of
                two teenagers who we, my wife and I, want to be exposed to cultures and environments.

            <h4>
                We have travelled out of the country to Jamaica, Bahamas, Dominican Republic, Turks
                and Caicos, England, Spain, Portugal, Morocco and Medellin, Colombia. Each country
                boasting thier cultural differences while demonstating that they are not much different
                from any where else.  The food maybe different, but the desire to eat is universal!

            <h4>
                So, if you have not travelled from state to state or country to country, take some time 
                to explore and share with those who have in this Travel App Api.
